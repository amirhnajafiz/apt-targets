# Test Targets

In this repository I implemented various systems in order to test them
with ```PTaaS``` for automatic penetration testing. These systems are all
kinds of ```software as a service``` applications.

## targets

All of the targets are in ```amirhossein21/test-target``` image repository on ```Dockerhub```.
The following tags are for special softwares.

- ```test-target:grpc-v0.0.1``` creates a ```grpc``` server on port ```50051```
- ```test-target:graphql-v0.0.1``` creates a ```graphql``` server on port ```4000```
- ```test-target:http-v0.0.1``` creates a ```http``` server on port ```3000```
- ```test-target:media-v0.0.1``` creates a ```media``` server on ```8000```
